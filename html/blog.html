                        <p class="fstline-22">Orthopedic pain is any pain that comes from the musculoskeletal system.
                            This pain can be caused by a
                            variety of factors, including injury, disease, and aging. Some of the most common causes of

                        <p class="fstline-22">Orthopedic pain can be acute or chronic. Acute pain is sudden and sharp,
                            and it usually goes away
                            within a few weeks or months. Chronic pain is long-lasting and may require ongoing

                                Arthritis is a condition that causes inflammation and degeneration of the joints. It can
                                cause
                                pain, swelling, and stiffness, leading to reduced mobility. The two primary types of
                                arthritis
                                are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis is the most common type of
                                arthritis
                                and is caused by wear and tear of the joints over time. Rheumatoid arthritis is an
                                autoimmune
                                disease that causes the immune system to attack the joints.

                                falls, sports injuries, and car accidents. The most common types of fractures are wrist
                                fractures, ankle fractures, and hip fractures.

                        <p class="fstline-22">The first step in diagnosing an orthopedic problem is to take a medical
                            history and perform a
                            physical examination. The doctor will ask you about your symptoms, when they started, and
                            what makes
                            them better or worse. The doctor will also examine the affected area and look for any signs
                            of
                            inflammation, swelling, or tenderness.</p>

                        <p class="fstline-22">In some cases, the doctor may order imaging tests, such as X-rays, MRI
                            scans, or CT scans, to get a
                            better look at the affected area. These tests can help to identify fractures, arthritis, and
                            other
                            orthopedic problems.</p>

                        <p class="fstline-22">Once the doctor has diagnosed the problem, they can develop a treatment
                            plan. Treatment options may

                                Obesity is a risk factor for many orthopedic problems, including osteoarthritis and back
                                pain.

                                Exercise helps to strengthen the muscles and bones, which can help to reduce the risk of
